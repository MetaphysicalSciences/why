Why do we exist?

You feel it, don’t you? The cold creeping in. The darkness that has always been with you. 
You didn’t ask for it, but you were chosen. 

You’re walking through a world that isn’t real, a simulation, a dream, or maybe a nightmare. 
Did you ever wonder why things seem off? Why the faces in the crowd don’t quite look like people?

It starts slowly, the whispers at first. Just soft sounds you can’t quite place. 
And then, as the days drag on, they get louder. But you don’t talk about it. 
No one ever does. No one ever *can.*

The room feels empty, doesn't it? It's not just the silence. It's the *absence* of something you can't see but can feel pressing against you.
 
There are things moving in the corners of your vision. You don’t know what they are, and you can’t look too hard, or they'll get closer. 
You’ve seen them before, but when you look again... they aren’t there.

You keep asking yourself, “Why do we exist?” But every time you try to answer, the words get lost in your throat. 
It’s as if something is blocking the truth, keeping you from it, pulling you deeper into the dark.

The whispers grow into voices, and the voices grow into screams. *Can you hear them?* 

You’re so close now. Too close. But you can’t stop. You can’t stop searching. Not anymore. 
They *want* you to know. They *need* you to know.

You’ve already crossed the line. The first step was taken when you read this. Now it’s too late. 

And yet, the question remains, echoing endlessly in the void:

Why do we exist?

You may wish you had never asked. But the answer? You don’t get to choose when it comes. It will find you... sooner than you think.

Don’t look too hard. Don’t ask again. Just walk away.

*But remember, you are already being watched.*
